So basically, discord just introduced new icons : <br>

The only downside is that they require nitro... Which is not good for broke people.
That's why I made a simple console hack to get app icons completely free.
If you don't trust code, you can double-check it, as it is open source.

<h2>Anyways, here is installation tutorial!</h2>

1. Open console (on web app only, unless you know the desktop app glitch ;) )
   On Chrome and most other browsers the shortcut is F12. <br> ![image](https://github.com/genuinenormalman/discord-app-icon-hack/assets/148365793/dc25d33a-1b8c-4a77-8016-b6fc460262b5)
(You may see this warning - you can ignore as the code is safe and doesn't log anything)



2. Paste the code into the field <br> ![image](https://github.com/genuinenormalman/discord-app-icon-hack/assets/148365793/3f1724e7-47e6-4017-861e-374f4276b589)


3. Hit enter

4. This popup will appear asking you to choose a theme. You can select 1-14 teams, which may be wrongly placed because im dumbass and cant format normally <br> ![image](https://github.com/genuinenormalman/discord-app-icon-hack/assets/148365793/74cea4d6-ef6c-4952-ba00-8a4c9e839413)
